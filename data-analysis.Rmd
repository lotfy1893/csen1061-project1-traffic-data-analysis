# Loading and Processing Data

We loaded the traffic-data.csv file to the R console to read it and start discovering the basic properties

'''{r}
traffic_data<- read.csv("traffic-data.csv",header=TRUE)
dim(traffic_data)
'''

The traffic dataset we have got about 429982 rows and 34 variables as columns, when we look at the data we will find that the first thing to do is to eliminate the advertisement columns as it has nothing relevant to our data investigation.

We can make use of the dplyr library verbs to eliminate certain columns with the method select(), from the dataset we can see that we have 13 columns concerning advertisement to be eliminated.

'''{r}
head(traffic_data %>% select(starts_with("ad")))
grep("ad", colnames(traffic_data))
traffic_roads<-traffic_data %>% select(-starts_with("ad"))
